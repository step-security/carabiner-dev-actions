# Carabiner Actions

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions for various tools in the
Carabiner ecosystem. These actions help streamline security policy verification,
attestation management, and supply chain security workflows.

## Actions

### login

The `login` action exchanges the workflow's GitHub OIDC identity for a
short-lived Carabiner token via the Carabiner token exchange server
(`auth.carabiner.dev` by default). The token is masked and exported as the
`CARABINER_CREDENTIALS` environment variable so later steps and Carabiner tools
can use it.

The exchange only succeeds when the repository's GitHub organization is claimed
as a namespace by a Carabiner organization **and** the repository has a
monitored pipeline; otherwise no token is issued. The issued token's lifetime is
paired to the workflow's OIDC token.

#### Usage

The calling job must grant `id-token: write` so the action can mint a workflow
OIDC token:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write   # required to mint the workflow OIDC token
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: carabiner-dev/actions/login@94f29392187fe5082d1195a7d4cae3a7ddf09d9c # v1.2.1 # pin to a release commit once tagged
      # CARABINER_CREDENTIALS is now set for subsequent steps
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `exchange-url` | No | `https://auth.carabiner.dev` | Base URL of the Carabiner token exchange server. The workflow OIDC token is minted for this audience. |
| `audience` | No | `https://api.carabiner.dev` | Audience (a Carabiner service URL) to request the token for. |
| `scope` | No | `attestations:read attestations:write` | Space-separated capability scopes to request. The issued token carries the intersection of the requested and granted scopes; set empty for an identity-only token. |

#### Outputs

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `expires-in` | Lifetime of the issued Carabiner token, in seconds. |
| `scope` | Space-separated scopes granted on the issued token (may be empty). |

See the [login README](login/README.md) for the full flow, security notes, and
troubleshooting.

### ampel/verify

The `ampel/verify` action verifies a subject (file or hash) against a security
policy using the 🔴🟡🟢 AMPEL supply chain policy engine. This action evaluates
whether a given artifact meets your defined security requirements by analyzing
its attestations against a policy.

#### Usage

```yaml
- uses: step-security/carabiner-dev-actions/ampel/verify@v1
  with:
    policy: 'path/to/policy.yaml'   # URI or path to policy code
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'     # or digest, eg sha256:98349875bf3e09...
    collector: 'github'             # Collectors used to retrieve attestations
```

#### Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `policy` | Yes | - | Path to the security policy file to evaluate against |
| `subject` | Yes | - | Path to a file or hash (algo:value) to use as verification subject |
| `collector` | Yes | - | Collector to load to read attestations (e.g., 'jsonl', 'github', 'coci', etc) |
| `attest` | No | `true` | Attest the policy evaluation results |
| `attest-format` | No | `ampel` | Format of the results attestation |
| `results-path` | No | `ampel.intoto.json` | Path to store the results attestation |
| `push-attestation` | No | `false` | Pushes the attestation to the GitHub attestations store |
| `attestation` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of additional attestations to ingest |
| `signer` | No | `""` | Comma separated list of expected signer identity slugs |
| `key` | No | `""` | Path to a key file to use for verification |
| `keydata` | No | `""` | Raw key material to use for verification |
| `fail` | No | `true` | Fail the workflow if the policy fails |

#### Examples

**Basic verification:**

```yaml
- uses: step-security/carabiner-dev-actions/ampel/verify@v1
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/binary'
    collector: 'github'
```

**Verification with custom attestations:**

```yaml
- uses: step-security/carabiner-dev-actions/ampel/verify@v1
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'sha256:abc123...'
    collector: 'oci'
    attestation: 'sbom.json,provenance.json'
    signer: 'github-actions,my-org'
```

**Verification with attestation push:**

```yaml
- uses: step-security/carabiner-dev-actions/ampel/verify@v1
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    attest: 'true'
    push-attestation: 'true'
    results-path: 'verification-results.json'
```

**Verification without failing the workflow:**

```yaml
- uses: step-security/carabiner-dev-actions/ampel/verify@v1
  with:
    policy: '.ampel/policy.yaml'
    subject: 'path/to/artifact'
    collector: 'github'
    fail: 'false'
```

### Available Installers

| Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install/ampel` | Installs the 🔴🟡🟢 AMPEL policy engine into the runner environment |
| `install/bnd` | Installs the Carabiner bnd attestation utility into the runner environment |
